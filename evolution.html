            <h2>The Evolution of Reptiles</h2>
            <p>The transition from amphibians to reptiles wasn't a sudden leap but a gradual process spanning millions of years. Understanding this evolution helps us appreciate the remarkable innovations that allowed life to fully conquer land.</p>

                    <h3>The Amphibian Ancestors</h3>
                    <p>Reptiles evolved from advanced amphibians called reptiliomorphs. These creatures already showed some reptile-like features, including stronger skeletons and less dependence on water.</p>

                    <h3>First True Reptiles</h3>
                    <p>Hylonomus and similar creatures appeared, featuring the critical amniotic egg. These small lizard-like animals, about 8 inches long, hunted insects in the coal forests of Nova Scotia.</p>

                    <h3>Reptilian Diversification Begins</h3>
                    <p>Reptiles split into multiple lineages, including the ancestors of modern turtles, lizards, and the extinct mammal-like reptiles.</p>

                    <h3>The Age of Reptiles Dawns</h3>
                    <p>Reptiles became the dominant land vertebrates, a position they would hold for over 200 million years, eventually giving rise to dinosaurs, marine reptiles, and flying pterosaurs.</p>

                    <h3>🥚 The Amniotic Egg</h3>
                    <p>This waterproof egg contained its own fluid-filled sac, protecting the developing embryo while allowing gas exchange. It was evolution's most important "invention" for land life.</p>

                    <h3>🦎 Scaly Skin</h3>
                    <p>Scales composed of keratin created a waterproof barrier, preventing dehydration and offering protection from predators and rough terrain.</p>

                    <h3>💨 Efficient Respiration</h3>
                    <p>Advanced lung structure with greater surface area allowed reptiles to extract more oxygen, supporting a more active lifestyle on land.</p>
