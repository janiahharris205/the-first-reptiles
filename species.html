            <h2>Early Reptilian Species</h2>
            <p>The first reptiles were relatively small and superficially lizard-like, but they represented an enormous leap forward in vertebrate evolution. Here are some of the most important early species:</p>

                <div class="species-card">
                    <h3>Hylonomus</h3>
                    <p><strong>Age:</strong> 312 million years ago</p>
                    <p><strong>Size:</strong> 8 inches (20 cm)</p>
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Often considered the oldest known reptile. Discovered in fossilized tree stumps in Nova Scotia, Canada. It was a small insectivore with sharp teeth and agile limbs.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="species-card">
                    <h3>Paleothyris</h3>
                    <p><strong>Age:</strong> 312 million years ago</p>
                    <p><strong>Size:</strong> 12 inches (30 cm)</p>
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> A contemporary of Hylonomus with similar features. Had a more robust skull and was likely a generalist predator of small invertebrates.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="species-card">
                    <h3>Petrolacosaurus</h3>
                    <p><strong>Age:</strong> 302 million years ago</p>
                    <p><strong>Size:</strong> 16 inches (40 cm)</p>
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> One of the earliest diapsid reptiles, meaning it had two holes in its skull behind the eyes. This lineage would eventually lead to dinosaurs and modern reptiles.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="species-card">
                    <h3>Captorhinus</h3>
                    <p><strong>Age:</strong> 290 million years ago</p>
                    <p><strong>Size:</strong> 16 inches (40 cm)</p>
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> A successful early reptile with multiple rows of teeth, suggesting an omnivorous diet. Survived well into the Permian Period.</p>
