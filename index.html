            <h2>The Dawn of Reptilian Life</h2>
            <p>The story of reptiles begins in the Carboniferous Period, approximately 320 million years ago. These remarkable creatures were the first vertebrates to become truly independent of water for reproduction, marking one of the most significant evolutionary milestones in Earth's history.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Key Innovation:</strong> The amniotic egg allowed reptiles to lay their eggs on land, freeing them from the aquatic lifestyle that bound their amphibian ancestors.
            </div>

            <h3>What Made Them Reptiles?</h3>
            <p>Early reptiles possessed several revolutionary adaptations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amniotic eggs:</strong> Protected embryos in a self-contained aquatic environment</li>
                <li><strong>Scaly skin:</strong> Prevented water loss and protected against injury</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced lungs:</strong> More efficient breathing than amphibians</li>
                <li><strong>Stronger limbs:</strong> Better suited for terrestrial locomotion</li>
                <li><strong>Different skull structure:</strong> More powerful jaws and varied tooth arrangements</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why They Succeeded</h3>
            <p>The Carboniferous world was dominated by vast swamp forests and changing climates. Reptiles thrived because they could:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Venture farther from water sources than amphibians</li>
                <li>Exploit new food sources in drier environments</li>
                <li>Survive seasonal droughts</li>
                <li>Reproduce in diverse habitats</li>
            </ul>
