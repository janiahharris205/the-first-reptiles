            <h2>The Fossil Record</h2>
            <p>Our knowledge of early reptiles comes from an incomplete but fascinating fossil record. These ancient remains tell us the story of life's conquest of land and reveal the incredible diversity that emerged from the first reptilian pioneers.</p>

            <h3>What Fossils Tell Us</h3>
            <p>The fossil record of early reptiles, while fragmentary, provides crucial insights:</p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>Skeletal Structure</h3>
                <p>Fossilized bones reveal skull openings, limb proportions, and vertebrae structure that distinguish reptiles from their amphibian ancestors. The development of additional skull openings (temporal fenestrae) was particularly important for jaw muscle attachment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>Geographic Distribution</h3>
                <p>Fossils show early reptiles quickly spread across the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea, adapting to various environments from humid coal swamps to drier upland areas.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>Environmental Context</h3>
                <p>Fossilized plant remains and sediments alongside reptile fossils reveal they lived in warm, humid forests dominated by giant ferns, horsetails, and early conifers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>Evolutionary Relationships</h3>
                <p>By comparing fossils from different time periods, paleontologists can trace the evolutionary branches that led to modern reptile groups and even to mammals and birds.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Preservation Challenges</h3>
                <p>Early reptile fossils are rare because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Small body size means delicate bones that are easily destroyed</li>
                    <li>Many lived in environments where fossilization was unlikely</li>
                    <li>Scavengers and decomposition often destroyed remains before burial</li>
                    <li>Hundreds of millions of years of geological processes have erased many deposits</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Despite these challenges, each new discovery adds valuable pieces to the puzzle of reptilian evolution.</p>
